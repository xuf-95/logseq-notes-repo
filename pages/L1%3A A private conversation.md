- Q:
- Last week, i went go to theatre. I had a very good site, the play was very interesting,  i didn't enjoy it. A young man and a young woman ware sitting behind me. They ware talking loudlly. I got very angry. I could round. I turned round, i looked at the man and women angrily. They did  not pay any attention. In they end i could not bear it.  "I turn around again. listen a word" i said angry, is not you business.a young man said rudly, this a not private conversation.
