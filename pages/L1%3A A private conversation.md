- Last week, i went go to theatre. I had a very good site, the play was very interesting,  i didn't enjoy it. A young man and a young woman ware sitting behind me. They ware talking loudly. I got very angry. I could round. I turned round, i looked at the man and women angrily. They did  not pay any attention. In they end i could not bear it. I turn around again, i can't hear a word!  i said angrily. 
  
  "It's none of your [[Business]]." the young man said very rudely. "This is a private conversation"
